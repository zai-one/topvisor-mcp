# Topvisor MCP

Topvisor projects, keywords and saved search positions.

Install it on your own computer or server and connect an MCP client. No AI Kit or
central ZAI platform installation is required. Provider credentials and API access
are required; provider charges and account restrictions still apply.

## Quick start

Install Python 3.12+ (below 3.15), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zai-one/topvisor-mcp.git
cd topvisor-mcp
uv sync --frozen
uv run --frozen python scripts/configure.py
uv run --frozen topvisor-mcp --config mcp.local.json --check-config
uv run --frozen topvisor-mcp --config mcp.local.json
```

The last command starts stdio and waits for an MCP client; it is not an interactive chat.
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for credentials, client configuration, HTTP and package integration.
`--check-config` checks local settings only; it never validates a provider account over the network.

## Included in 0.2.0

Read saved positions with topvisor_positions_history; region_indexes are indexes from project setup, not geographic region codes. Paid position checks are not exposed.

Existing tool names and schemas remain supported. Writes and paid operations retain
their server policy and approval controls. See [runtime configuration](docs/RUNTIME.md).

## Verification

```sh
uv sync --frozen --all-groups
uv run --frozen python scripts/verify.py
uv run --frozen python scripts/verify_install.py
```

Tests use synthetic fixtures. A passing test run does not establish live provider connectivity.

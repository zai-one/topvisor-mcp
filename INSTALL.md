# Install and integrate Topvisor MCP

## From a clone or source ZIP

Follow [Quick start](README.md#quick-start). A source ZIP works with the same commands
after extracting and entering its directory. No `.git` checkout is needed at runtime.
The wizard refuses to overwrite existing `mcp.local.json` or `secrets/`.
For an existing setup, edit your files explicitly instead of rerunning it.
If a setup was interrupted, inspect and complete those local files; nothing starts automatically.

`mcp.local.json` contains an `env` object. Values are strings; only this service's
prefix is accepted. Paths ending in `_FILE` or `_STATE_PATH` resolve relative to the
config file. Explicit config values override inherited environment. There is no shell
expansion or automatic dotenv loading. Credential contents remain in private files.

The wizard stores the API token in an owner-private file. Supply the provider account/project ID when prompted.


On Linux, private files need mode 0600 and private directories 0700. On Windows,
use private ACLs; the wizard restricts its new secrets directory to the current user
and SYSTEM. Pre-existing provider files require equivalent protection by the operator.
Keep SQLite state across upgrades. Never delete it to retry an unknown write.

## MCP clients

Use an absolute checkout path (forward slashes work in JSON on Windows, e.g.
`C:/Users/you/mcp/topvisor-mcp`). Give the MCP client this stdio configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "topvisor": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/topvisor-mcp",
        "run",
        "--frozen",
        "topvisor-mcp",
        "--config",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/topvisor-mcp/mcp.local.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This is the usual `mcpServers` format for Claude Desktop and Cursor. For clients
using a different outer schema, reuse the same command and args. The executable
`uv` must be on the client process's PATH; otherwise use its absolute path.
Do not run a second copy manually while the client manages its stdio process.

## HTTP

```sh
uv run --frozen topvisor-mcp --config mcp.local.json --transport http --check-config
uv run --frozen topvisor-mcp --config mcp.local.json --transport http --host 127.0.0.1
```

Configure `TOPVISOR_MCP_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` with an RSA verification key and issue
RS256 JWTs from a trusted issuer with matching `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `sub`, `account_id`
and service scopes. [Runtime reference](docs/RUNTIME.md) specifies scopes and defaults.
Endpoint: `/mcp`. HTTP always requires authentication; use TLS for network access.
The local configuration check never generates a signing key or an access token.

## Python package and platform integration

```sh
uv build
python -m pip install "dist/zai_topvisor_mcp-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl"
topvisor-mcp --config /ABSOLUTE/PATH/mcp.local.json
```

For reproducible integration, use the release wheel and verify its SHA-256; pin
the version and lock dependencies in the consuming application. The package can
also be consumed through its `create_server(ServiceConfig(...), transport=...)` API.
Keep secrets, account bindings and write approvals under the host's control.
Installing the package does not grant additional provider permissions.

## Verification

`scripts/verify.py` runs lint and offline tests. `scripts/verify_install.py` builds a
wheel, installs it into a fresh environment and discovers tools over real stdio
from an unrelated directory using synthetic settings. It makes no provider calls.
CI runs on Linux and Windows with Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14. Live provider account
validation remains an operator step after installation.
